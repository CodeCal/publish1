<h1>Types of Networks</h1>
<h2>Local Area Networks (LANs)</h2>
<h2>Wide Area Networks (WANs)</h2>



<h1>Open Systems Interconnection Model (OSI)</h1><p>--is a conceptual model that characterises and standardises the 
communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without 
regard to its underlying internal structure and technology</p>

<h2>7. Application Layer</h2>
<h2>6. Presentation Layer</h2>
<h2>5. Session Layer</h2>
<h2>4. Transport Layer</h2>
<h2>3. Network Layer</h2><p>--packets</p>
<h2>2. Data Link Layer</h2><p></p>
<h2>1. Physical Layer</h2><p>--bits</p>

<h2>Physical Topologies</h2>
<p>CSMA/CA = Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Avoidance (wireless networks)</p>
<p>CSMA/CD = Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Detection (wired networks)</p>
<p>Exponential Backoff--used by both ethernet and wireless networks to enable collision avoidance/detection and deconfliction</p>
<h3>Collision Domain</h3><p>--used to shrink number of devices on carrier in order to reduce collisions</p>
<h4>Switch</h4>
<h4>Routing</h4>
<p>Hop Limit--used to determine which route is used. </p>
<p>Packet Switching--chop up packets and route--called packet switching in order to promise delivery of packets which can be reassembled in order.</p>

<p> Protocols that enable decentralized transfers: Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) and Board Gateway Protocol (BGP)</p>
<p>World's first packet-switch network ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency...NET)</p>
  
<p>DDNS = Dynamic DNS; can avoid this by forwarding traffic from your hosted address to your dynamic address or by using "no IP" services online which do the equivalent.</p>


<h3>Bus Topology (archaic)</h3>
<p>everything is connected by a single bus -- coaxial cable</p>
<h3>Ring Topology (archaic)</h3><p>--exactly what it sounds like. each computer is connected to two computers.</p>
<p>unidirectional or bidirectional</p>
<h3>Star Topology</h3><p>--central device is switch or hub</p>
<p>central device is single point of failure</p>
<h3>Mesh Topology</h3><p>--each device is connected to every other device by separate cabling</p>
<p>used in wide area networks (WANs) for redundancy. Expensive install.</p>


<h1>Note: most networks are a hybrid type of physical topology</h1>


<h2>Media Access Control (MAC) Address</h2>

<h2>Network Interface Card (NIC)</h2>
<p>Can be expansion devise, USB, or built directly into the motherboard</p>

<h2>Hubs</h2>
